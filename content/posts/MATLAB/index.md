## About the system
The work is based on the vmware virtual machine provided by the github getting started. It contains: 
* ROS 2 Dashing desktop installation
* ROS Melodic desktop installation
* Gazebo robot simulator 9.0.0
* Example Gazebo worlds for a simulated TurtleBot® 3

Checking the version of the software packages
```
lsb_release -a
gazebo -v
```

* ubunto version: 18.04.5
* gazebo version 9.16.0

The project uses ros_kortex  robotic arm for the virtual manipulator  


## Config
There are different platforms where to run vmware workstation player and virtual box. The tutorial recommends using the vmware route and issues where found while using virtual box

### vmware 
While running the virtual machine some errors were encounter  
```
Error while powering on: VMware Player does not support nested virtualization on this host.
```
Which were fix by disabling the ```virtual CPU performance counters``` and ```Virtual Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI``` settings 


### Virtual box (Not recommended)
* Running and testing the vm (virtual machine) works
* Take a snapshot of the vm in order to have a backup to go back to if something goes wrong.  
* Using virtual box Guest additions to get full-screen 
* Activate share clipboard to copy paste to work between both in host and guest
* Configure Network between guest and host. Here there are two options:
  * Enable network adapter with bridge configuration. issue: scripts file where the ros_master URI is configured fail because many network interfaces are recognized so the ros_master URI needs to be manually defined.  
  ![Network configuration](network-config.png)
  * Enable network adapter with __NAT__ configuration and allow __port forwarding__ in advance settings. The port 11311 needs to be forward in order for the host computer to connect to ROS network.  NAT (Network Address Translation) creates a private network for the guest vm So the IP address used from inside the guest ```192.168.56.1``` is different tha the used by the host computer ```192.168.56.1```. issue: ROS services does not working properly with MATLAB. Note: Check the virtual box network tool to identify network adaptor of the host computer ```192.168.56.1```


Once a virtual machine is setup and running some minor configuration are made in order to make it easier to use

* Add [Spanish keyboard](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1014585/how-to-add-a-latin-american-keyboard-in-17-10): changing the default keyboard layout from English to Spanish  simplifies the use of special characters

  ```
  sudo locale-gen es_AR.UTF-8
  ```

* Add the setup file from ROS and catkin environment to bash, in order to add the ROS environment variable and be able to run ROS command from the shell. 
```
echo 'source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash' >>  ~/.bashrc
echo 'source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash' >>  ~/.bashrc
```
* try running ```rostopic list``` to test it is working 


## Environment exploration
Files related to the project are located at the Desktop inside the Robocup Challenge folder. Exploring these files ( ```Example World 1.desktop```) from the command line give an insight in how they work
```
cd "~/Desktop/RoboCup Challenge"
less "Example World 1.desktop"
```

Content of  ```Example World 1.desktop```: 
```
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Comment=Launch example world for RoboCup challenge
Exec=/home/user/start-robocup-example-world-1.sh
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;Application;
Icon=/usr/share/icons/Tango/32x32/mimetypes/gnome-mime-application-x-executable.png
Name[en_US]=Example World 1
```

This file launches a  shell script ```~/start-robocup-example-world-1.sh```

```
less ~/start-robocup-example-world-1.sh
```

Content of ```~/start-robocup-example-world-1.sh```:
```
#!/bin/sh
# Shortcut shell script to start pickandplace recycling world
export SVGA_VGPU10=0
export ROS_IP=$(hostname -I | tr -d [:blank:])
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://$ROS_IP:11311
export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=/home/user/src/GazeboPlugin/export:$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH
# Launch Gazebo world with kortex
gnome-terminal --title="Gazebo Recycling World - Depth Sensing" -- /bin/bash -c 'source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash; source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash; roslaunch kortex_gazebo_depth pickplace.launch world:=RoboCup_1.world '
```

This file open a gazebo world from the ROS project found at  ```~/catkin_ws/```


search for the robot model (urdf) 
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
ls -R | grep urdf
```

```./src/ros_kortex/kortex_description/arms/gen3/urdf```

### Connect to MATLAB 
* Select on of the available example files located on the RoboCup Challenge folder, it would run a gazebo world and start ROS.
* Open MATLAb and run the following script to connect to 

```{matlab}
%% Connect to ROs Network
clc
ipaddress = '192.168.182.128';

rosshutdown
rosinit(ipaddress,11311);

% Initializing global node /matlab_global_node_47691 with NodeURI http://192.168.56.1:59106/
```
The MATLAB command ```rosshutdown``` ends the connection
 
ROS action client 

### Basic ROS commands 
```
%% testing ROS commands 
rosaction("list")
rostopic("info", "tf")
rostopic("info", "clock")
svclist =rosservice("list");
rosservice("info","/gazebo/set_model_configuration")
rosservice info '/gazebo/set_model_configuration'
```
## Important information 
variables of interest:
* rostopic: '/my_gen3/joint_states'
  * message type: 'sensor_msgs/JointState'
