This is a phrase that has stuck with me since the first time I read it in The Tales of the Black Widowers by Isaac Asimov. Asimov is one of my favorite authors. He encapsulates a genuine wonder for the world and all what is around him. Through the lense of science fiction he builds a reflection of our own world with little sprinkles of speculation here and there to make something that feels foreign and yet very familiar. So my way of answering this question would be.\n The world is a fascinating place, but we only get to live inside the boundary of what we know therefore I justify my existence by expanding this horizon to the farthest I can, and be amazed and amused by what there is out there.\n Building this website Let\u0026rsquo;s start from the beginning, I been thinking about writing for a long time but have struggled to do it for any meaningful length of time and keep up with it. I don\u0026rsquo;t know when you are reading this but 2020/2021 have been period defined by a global pandemic which caused a rapid adoption of digital technologies. The times are changing so adapting to this new world with a bigger digital presence is a must.\nThat is why I start this project. If you want to get started creating a website of your own there a many alternatives, actually, too many. So many that it can become overwhelming. If you are wondering how this website in particular is made I used HUGO a static website builder based on go, HUGO works via themes to get a particular feel and aestethic I used the hugo toha theme and fork a exemplary git repository which holds a generic site.\n Spoilers: the template supports multilingual the forked example was in Bengali (বাংলা) 🇧🇩.\n This is not my first trying HUGO, a while back I tried using it with a different template. In the end I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel very confortable using it because my lack of experience but now trying it again, it feels a bit easier do to the fact that I have already tried it and become more familiar with the tool means I had already overcome some roadblocks and had to faceoff a new set of challenges.\nStarting a new project may be hard, you would find roadblocks that stop you right in your tracks, you might quit but even then it is not a waste of time if you ever return you no longer start from zero and bit by bit you get to advance.\nIf you have gone this far I really appreciate it and hope you find the rest of the content in this posts just as interesting if not even more.

The tutorial recommends using the vmware route and issues where found while using virtual box\nvmware While running the virtual machine some errors were encounter\nError while powering on: VMware Player does not support nested virtualization on this host. Which were fix by disabling the virtual CPU performance counters and Virtual Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI settings and disable side channel mitigation\nVirtual box (Not recommended)  Running and testing the vm (virtual machine) works Take a snapshot of the vm in order to have a backup to go back to if something goes wrong.

Here there are two options:  Enable network adapter with bridge configuration. issue: scripts file where the ros_master URI is configured fail because many network interfaces are recognized so the ros_master URI needs to be manually defined.\n Enable network adapter with NAT configuration and allow port forwarding in advance settings. The port 11311 needs to be forward in order for the host computer to connect to ROS network. NAT (Network Address Translation) creates a private network for the guest vm So the IP address used from inside the guest 192.168.56.1 is different tha the used by the host computer 192.168.56.1. issue: ROS services does not working properly with MATLAB.

(1859)\n De las anteriores dos citas se evidencia el conocimiento de astronomía que poseía Charles Dickens, y como lo influía a contemplar un punto de vista más allá de la tierra, donde todo lo que conocemos es minúsculo.\nA pale blue dot    From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest.\nBut for us, it\u0026rsquo;s different. Look again at that dot. That\u0026rsquo;s here. That\u0026rsquo;s home. That\u0026rsquo;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, ever king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every \u0026ldquo;superstar,” every \u0026ldquo;supreme leader,\u0026rdquo; every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.\nThe Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.\nOur posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.\nIt has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we\u0026rsquo;ve ever known.\n\u0026mdash; Carl Sagan, A pale blue dot\n  For the very reason that here nothing served a purpose -not ever, not to anyone- and that here no guillotine of evolution was in play, nature, constrained neither by the life she bore nor by the death she inflicted, could achieve liberation, displaying a prodigality characteristic of herself, a limitless wastefulness, a brute magnificence that was useless, a eternal power of creation without a goal, without a need, without a meaning.\n\u0026mdash; Stanislaw Lem, Fiasco\n  Es un sentimiento creciente entre algunos grupos de este país la noción de que cuando un hombre o una compañía han sacado un beneficio del publico durante un cierto número de años, el gobierno y los tribunales tienen el deber de salvaguardar esos beneficios en el futuro, incluso frente a circunstancias de cambio y contra el interés del publico\u0026hellip; Ni los individuos ni las corporaciones tienen el menor derecho de acudir a los tribunales y exigir que el reloj de la historia sea detenido, o retrasado, en beneficio particular suyo.\n\u0026mdash;Robert.A Heinlein, La línea de la vida\n  The intensity of every astonishment gradually wear off; the human mind, by the sheer effect of repetition and habit, gradually becomes accustomed to the strangest and least familiar ideas.\n\u0026mdash; Milic Capek, The philosophical impact of contemporary physics\n  El coronel experimentó la sensación de que nacían hongos y lirios venenosos en sus tripas.\n\u0026mdash; Gabriel Garcia Marquez, El coronel no tiene quien le escriba\n Antítesis entre la belleza de los lirios y el malestar que representan.\n Fue en aquella cabaña perdida en las montañas del Gran Khingam donde algo comenzó a cambiar en el interior de Ye Wenjie.

No sabia si tiraba o era arrastrado, pero avanzaba lo más rápido posible, sin tener tiempo de pensar a donde conduciría ese movimiento.\n\u0026mdash; Leon Tolstoi, Guerra y paz\n  Bismark esta convencido de que salió victorioso de la ultima guerra a causa de complicadas, astutas y profundas consideraciones estatales. Los miembro del Vaterland piensan que fue fruto de patriotismo. Los ingleses piensan que fueron más astutos que Napoleón y todo lo que ellos piensan no ha sido sino creado por su imaginación con ayuda de su intelecto para justificar la necesidad de derramamiento de sangre de la sociedad europea. La misma necesidad que tienen las hormigas negras y amarillas de aniquilarse las unas a otra y de construir sus hormigueros del mismo modo.\n\u0026mdash; Leon Tolstoi, Guerra y paz\n  En los acontecimientos históricos las grandes personalidades son las etiquetas que dan la denominación al acontecimiento pero son las que, al igual que las etiquetas, tienen una menor relación con el acontecimiento\n\u0026mdash; Leon Tolstoi, Guerra y paz\n  El fuego detrás del cuarzo estaba ahora débil, encaminándose a regañadientes hacia la muerte.\n\u0026mdash; Isaac Asimov, se puede evitar un conflicto\n  Oía el corazón.

La liga de los pelirrojos\n Este fragmento que sucede en dialogo entre Sherlock Holmes y Watson puede tomarse como consejo de Sir Arthur Conan Doyle que puede ser aplicado para realizar escritos de ficción basados en eventos reales.\n It is my belief, Watson, found upon my experience , that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful country side.\n\u0026mdash; Arthur Conan Doyle, The adventure of the Cooper Beeches\n What I find interesting about this quote is not that I find it true but rather it is telling of a way of thinking of Conan Doyle, a glimpse on how he saw and felt about the world.\nSherlock Holmes strikes as a very modern and relatable character, his life in some way resembles our modern life, he rides carriages as we would a taxi, he has meals and drinks coffee as part of his daily routine, and the fact that he has to pay rent to his land lady miss Turner are small details of normal life that makes you feel fully immerse and think of his stories as realistic as your own experiences.\n Se equivoca, profesor. Que el vulgo crea en cometas extraordinarios que atraviesan el espacio, o en la existencia de monstruos antediluvianos que pueblan el interior del la tierra, pase, pero ni el astrónomo ni el geólogo admiten tales quimeras.\n\u0026mdash; Julio Verne, Veinte mil leguas de viaje submarino\n  ¿Acaso no existe ninguna manera de gobernar el mundo sin hacer que la violencia sea la manera decisiva de juzgar entre el bien y el mal? \u0026hellip; vivimos en un mundo en el que la Union Soviética dispone de suficiente armamento como para mater cincuenta veces a cada habitante de la tierra, pero se siente insegura porque los Estados Unidos tienen suficiente armamento como para matar a todos sesenta veces.\n\u0026mdash; Isaac Asimov, No violencia. La visita del tiranosaurio- prologo Penterra\n  La posteridad considera una revolución triunfante como el levantamiento de una nación o de un grupo que forman un solo frente, pero la mayoría de las veces esa idea no es más que un lustre patriótico que se da al recuerdo. En toda revolución, aquellos que siguen fervorosamente la lucha hasta la muerte son una minoría, y suele haber un numero al menos igual que son decididamente antirrevolucionarios, más una mayoría efectiva que es apática y va a donde la llevan ( en una u otra dirección) si es necesario, pero prefiere que la dejen en paz\n\u0026mdash; Isaac Asimov, Guía de la biblia nuevo testamento\n  Cuando la historia se ocupa de las personalidades, las descripciones son blancas o negra, según los intereses del escritor.\n\u0026mdash;Asimov, Segunda fundación\n  Lo que hace más importante a tu rosa es el tiempo que tú has perdido con ella\n\u0026mdash; Antonie De Saint Exupery.

Rather they focus on the rational, gradual discovery of what has happened (or will, or should happen) frequently resulting in detective story like narrative structures \u0026hellip;\nit is this sense of accumulating evidence, or knowledge and understanding of the world and the events described, which creates the narrative tension much of Asimov\u0026rsquo;s work.\n\u0026mdash; Jari Kakela\n  Establishing the historicity of the present in the sense of denaturalizing the present by showing it to be neither arbitrary nor inevitable but the conjunctural result of complex, knowable material processes.\nCarl Freedman, Critical theory and science fiction\n  Es cierto que la nación no se crea por leyes ni decretos, sobre todo en Colombia, pues sabido es que muchas normas estipuladas en la Constitución son letra muerta\n\u0026mdash; María Elena Erazo, Construcción de la nación Colombiana\n  Ustedes se deleitan haciendo leyes pero más se deleitan burlándolas como los niños que jugando en la playa levantan con paciencia castillo de arena que luego destruyen entre risas.\n\u0026mdash; Facundo Cabral, El profeta de Gibran\n  E-government is defined as a way for governments to use the most innovative information and communication technologies, particularly web-based applications, to provide citizens and business with more convenient access to government information and services\n\u0026mdash; Zhiyuan Fang, Egoverments in digital era\n  Se habla a veces de hecho, de la crueldad \u0026laquo;bestial\u0026raquo; del hombre, pero esto es terriblemente injusto y ofensivo para las bestias: una bestia nunca puede ser tan cruel como el hombre , tan artística, tan plásticamente cruel.\n\u0026mdash; Fiodor Dostievskin, Los hermanos Karamazov\n  Let me tell you, my friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered the electricity - who would themselves not so long before have been burned as wizards,\n\u0026mdash; Bram stroker, Dracula\n  El ni siquiera tomo aliento para explicar que las cucarachas, el insecto más antiguo sobre la tierra, era ya la víctima favorita de los chancletazos en el Antiguo Testamento, pero que como especie era definitivamente refractaria a cualquier método de exterminio, desde las rebanadas de tomate con boráx hasta la harina con azúcar, pues sus mil seiscientas tres variedades habían resistido a la más remota,tenaz y despiadada persecución que el hombre había desatado desde sus orígenes contra ser viviente alguno, inclusive el propio hombre, hasta el extremo de que así como se atribuía al género humano un instinto de reproducción, debía atribuírsele otro más definido y apremiante, que era el instinto de matar cucarachas, y que si éstas habían logrado escapar a la ferocidad humana era porque se habían refugiado en las tinieblas, donde se hicieron invulnerables por el miedo congénito del hombre a la oscuridad.\n\u0026mdash; Gabriel Garcia Marquez, cien años de soledad\n   Diremos que lo encotramos flotando en la canastilla - sonrió No se lo creerá nadie- dijo la monja Si se lo creyeron a las Sagradas Escritura - replico Fernanda-, no veo por qué no han de creérmelo a mi  \u0026mdash; Gabriel Garcia Marquez, cien años de soledad\n  Era en aquel momento temprano del reinado que cada pueblo vive unas cinco veces en un siglo. Un periodo revolucionario, diferente de lo que llamamos \u0026laquo;revolución\u0026raquo; solo por el hecho de que el poder está en manos del antiguo gobierno y no del nuevo. En estas revoluciones, como en todas las demás, se habla del espíritu de los nuevos tiempos, de las exigencias de este tiempo, de los derechos del hombre, de la necesidad de que impere la sensatez en la estructura del estad y la justicia general. Bajo el pretexto de estas ideas, también entran en liza las pasiones más irrazonables del hombre. Pasarán el tiempo y las ganas, y los antiguos introductores de lo novedoso se aferrarán a su antiguo orden nuevo, ahora anticuado, y defenderán la decoración de su casa frente a la juventud que crece, que de nuevo quiere y necesita satisfacer su necesidad de probar fuerzas.\n\u0026mdash; Leon Tolstoi, Guerra y paz\n  The crusade was failing on the shore of the promised land, its prophet entrenched in its vision, its soldier-priest lost in self-doubt.

Today, we often take for granted those symbols and explanations that are neatly compiled into math and science textbooks. It is easy to forget that every equation encases a story: frustration, fascination, arduous work, friendly collaborations, disappointment, and the occasional serendipity. Mathematics is not just about numbers, but it is also about the people whose work gives us the luxury and pleasure of understanding.\n\u0026mdash; Rafael Villarreal-Calderon, Chopping Logs: A Look at the History and Uses of Logarithms\n  El trabajo de Boltzmann no negaba la vigencia de las leyes de Newton; simplemente era una forma nueva de tratar inmensos conjuntos de partículas. Esto no fue entendido bien por buena parte de sus contemporáneos, para los cuales era difícil aceptar que lo que hasta entonces se consideraban leyes fundamentales de la naturaleza, como el segundo principio de la termodinámica, pudieran tener una interpretación estadística, minando así su carácter estrictamente determinista.\n  Thus a familiar model connected to physical intuition, but constituting matter of some ill-understood sort of wave, confronted an abstract mathematics with seemingly bizarra variables, insistent about discontinuity and suspending space-time pictures. Unsurprisingly, the coexistence of alternative theories generated debate. The fact, soon demonstrated, of their mathematical equivalence did not resolve the interpretative dispute. For fundamentally different physical pictures were offer.\n\u0026mdash; Catheryn Carson, The origins of the quantum theory\n  Talk about an equimanicla problem of epic proportions.

If there is any one thing upon which this intelligence depends it would seem to be organization\n\u0026mdash; Douglas Engelbart, Augmenting Human Intellect\n  The user is at first a virtuality to be invented by the designer and realized along with the technology. Or to put it the other way around, technological innovation initially entails a script that defines specific characters as its users, independent of any real actors who might take those parts.\n\u0026mdash;Thierry Bardin, bootstrapping Douglas Endelbart and the origins of Personal Computing\n  It started \u0026hellip; when I began work \u0026hellip; on the design of interactive systems to be used by office workers for document preparation.

But some of the yesterday\u0026rsquo;s questions remain unanswered about the future of the personal computer, and indeed, about the future of the person who used it. Clues to what those answers might be sometimes can be found by remembering and reevaluating what did not prevail.\n\u0026mdash;Thierry Bardin, bootstrapping Douglas Endelbart and the origins of Personal Computing\n  The great success of the internet is not technical, but in human impact.

Of course, just as the skilled carpenter, the skilled mechanic, the skilled dressmaker have in some degree survived the first industrial revolution, so the skilled scientist and the skilled administrator may survive the second. However, taking the second revolution as accomplished, the average human being of mediocre attainments or less has nothing to sell that it is worth anyone’s money to buy.\nThe answer, of course, is to have a society based on human values other than buying or selling.
